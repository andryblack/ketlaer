This version (0.2.2) is for mms-1.1.0 revno 1202+ only.
If you want to use this theme with an older MMS version,
you have to replace all bg-10-*.png background images
from an older version. E.g.: 0.2.1.

Thanks Yann for help.
Background gradients are now without stripes.
EPG in the bright theme adjusted.
