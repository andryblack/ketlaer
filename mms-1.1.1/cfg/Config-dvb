#
# If you just want to use the shutdown script you can disable the
# normal quit

# "shutdown -h now" will shut the computer down when quiting mms

# mode. Idle mode currently supports screensaver for automatic

# Valid values are integers and the time is measured in minutes. 0
# denotes disabled.

# The debug level

#  Movie    Play movies from harddrive
#  Movie:0  Play movies from harddrive
#  Movie:1  Play a dvd/vcd/svcd
