# Directories
#
# you can add several folders by simple having multiple entries
#
picture_dir = /media/

# If your directories are stored on a network storage you can specify
# them underneath instead of specifying them as picture_dir. The
# difference is that MMS will not try to add needless inotify watches
# to directories specified in this way
#
#picture_dir_no_watch = /media/

# Pictures dirs to exclude
#
# Exclude dirs with the following names from coming up in pictures
# You can specify as many as needed
#
# Eg.
#exclude_picture_dir = .xvpic
