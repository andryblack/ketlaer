### GENERAL ####

# Convert
#
# Convert files in locale format to utf-8?
# This option is needed if filenames on is encoded in a different
# format than utf-8
convert = true

# different than the filenames (eg. Russian)

# Show quit
#
# If you just want to use the shutdown script you can disable the
# normal quit

# "shutdown -h now" will shut the computer down when quiting mms

# Idle_time is used to set after how long time mms should go into idle
# mode. Idle mode currently supports screensaver for automatic
# updating of epg and an audio screensaver that will kick in if audio
# is playing.
#
# Valid values are integers and the time is measured in minutes. 0
# denotes disabled.

# The debug level
#
# Controls how much debug will be displayed:

# Show media dependant options in startmenu?

#  Movie    Play movies from harddrive
#  Movie:0  Play movies from harddrive

# This section also controls movie playback
