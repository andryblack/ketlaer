# If your directories are stored on a network storage you can specify

# to directories specified in this way

# one to download imdb information for movies and display stats about
# the movie such as resolution and audio streams

# It accepts values between 0 and 9 (included). Higher values 
# help preventing graphich artifacts in thumbnails, but at cost of

# Thumbnail creation: skip blank or poorly detailed frames when
# creating thumbnails (only if mms is compiled to use the internal
# thumbnailer). Warning: thumbnailing becomes a lot slower
# and risk of blank thumbnails is reduced, but not eliminated.
# 0 means disabled (i.e. thumbnailing will proceed as usual)
# Any other value affects:
# 1) the minimum level of deviance the program looks for while
#    picking the frame from which it builds the thumbnail
# 2) how deep into the stream the program is allowed to seek 
#    while searching for the suitable frame
# A level of 2 or 3 should be enough to prevent blank thumbnails
# in most cases. 
# default: 0 (disabled)
