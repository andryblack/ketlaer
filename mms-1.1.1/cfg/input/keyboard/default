# Example configuration file for keyboard input
#
# Syntax:
# mode, command, key
#
# some modes inherit from other modes, which means that you can't
# define the same key in both. Otherwise you are free to use the same
# keys.
#
# all inherit from general
# all audio modes inherit from audio_general
# choose_playlist and playlist inherit from playlist_general
#
