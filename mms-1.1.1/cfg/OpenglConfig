# My Media System - Opengl configuration file
#
# For more information on the options refer to the complete
# documentation:
#
# http://mms.kicks-ass.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
#

version = 7 


# Opengl screen/window size
#
# It's also useful to upscale/downscale the GUI of mms in combination with 
# the resolution values set in the main Config file
#
#default:
# opengl_h: (horizontal) same value as the one in h_res set in the main Config file
# opengl_v: (vertical) same value as the one in v_res set in the main Config file



# borderless
# Window borderless attribute
#
# default:
# borderless = false

borderless = false


# mousecursor 
# Mouse cursor visibility
#
# values are:
# enabled - mouse cursor is visible both in window and full screen modes
# disabled - mouse cursor is always disabled
# nofs - mouse cursor is visible if mms runs in window mode, otherwise it's hidden
# default:
# mousecursor = nofs 

mousecursor = enabled 


# transfer_mode
# How the plugin transfers data from system memory to the graphic card memory
# values are:
# DMA - The plugin will try to use DMA to transfer data to the graphic card. It requires a version of OpenGL that supports 
#       the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension and it uses the glBufferSubData() API 
# mmap -The plugin will try to map texture buffers to the client's address space. It requires a version of OpenGL that supports
#	the GL_EXT_pixel_buffer_object extension and it uses the glMapBuffer() API
# standard - it uses the glTexSubImage2D() API to transfer texture data to the texture buffers. It requires 
# 	the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension to render NPOS (non-power-of-two) sized textures. This is the most compatible
# 	method albeit the slower.
# default:
# transfer_mode = standard

transfer_mode = DMA


# benchmark 
# The Opengl plugin may print some benchmarks results from time to time
#
# values are:
# 0 - benchmarking is disabled
# higher values instruct the plugin to print benchmark results every <value>*100 drawings.
# default:
# benchmark = 5

benchmark = 5

 
# vsync
# This option sets the vertical sync mode
#
# WARNING: it has no effect if vertical sync is enabled system wide (for example from the nvidia-settings applet)
# values are:
# 0      - no vertical sync is performed
# 1      - drawings are done during the vertical sync
# x > 1  - drawings are done each x vertical syncs... this actually slows things down for no reason, but if you're happy with it...
# default:
# vsync = 0


# verbose
# If enabled, you get more messages on console
# Verbosity also depends on debug_level in the main Config file
#
# values are:
# true
# false
# default:
# verbose = false
