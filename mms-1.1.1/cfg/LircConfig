### LIRC ####

version = 2

# Lirc delay
#
# Determines how many miliseconds mms should wait between keys. This
# is used to make sure keys are not skippe. A lower number will make
# navigation faster but might cause double presses.
#
lirc_delay = 200


# Lirc rate
#
# Determines the keypress rate
# 0 = it accepts only 1 keypress in the lirc_delay time span
# 1 = it accepts every keypress
# 2 = it accept every second keypress
# 3 = it accepts every 3rd keypress
# etc.
# 
# default: 1
#
lirc_rate = 1


# Lirc fast
#
# If lirc_rate > 0, drops repeated presses till the "lirc_fast"th one
# then it behaves accordingly to the lirc_rate setting
#
# lirc_fast  = 0 : this is disabled
# lirc_fast  > 0 : enabled
#
# default: 3

lirc_fast = 3
