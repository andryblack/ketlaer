This pyglet is a very simple filemanager to manage your media folders
and removable devices (usb storage, music player, CDROM...) from
within MMS, using remote or keyboard (up, down, right, left, action).

Exit button will make you exit from the pyglet.

It works a little as Midnight Commander : The left selection is
copied/moved/linked in the right folder.

It only provides basic actions :
- copying (cp)
- moving (mv)
- linking (ln for files, ln -s for folders)

## CONFIGURING OPTIONS
You have to edit the mountpoints, the fakeroot facilities, you have to edit filemanager.py
(all editable parameters are at the top of this file) :
### EDIT HERE :
# syntax is : [ DISPLAYED_NAME, DEVICE, MOUNTPOINT ]
mountpoints = [ ["DVD Rom", '/dev/dvd', '/media/dvd'],
               ["Archos Jukebox", '/dev/sda1', '/mnt/jukebox'],
             ]

# To only allow a subset of the file system to be viewable :
# Note that there is no real fakeroot, just masquerading, if
# you have symbolic links, it will be possible to escape from the jail !!!
# No fakeroot : fakeroot =['/',]
fakeroot = ['/media', '/tmp', '/data/data/Videos']

# The commands to mount/umount (adjust to suit your needs, if using sudo, update the sudoers table so that
# the user MMS is launched under has the right to use mount and unmount wthout password (NOPASSWD)
mount_command  = "/usr/bin/sudo /bin/mount"
umount_command = "/usr/bin/sudo /bin/umount"

# This is for masking dot_files or not :
HIDE_DOT_FILES = False
### END USER EDITION
