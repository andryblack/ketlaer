Since MMS is now built from a core and several plugins, each plugin
has it's own translation. In order to find all translatable strings
use the following command:

find ./ -name po

In the root directory.

If you want to find out if you, as a translater, has translated all
strings, use the following command:

for i in `find ./ -name po`; do make -C $i; done
