directvnc for Debian
--------------------

To be able to run this software you need access to the /dev/fb0 device
so the user needs to be in the video group. The user will also need
access to /dev/mouse or /dev/psaux to be able to run directvnc.

Also note that access to /dev/tty0 will be needed if more than one
directFB app is used at the same time.
