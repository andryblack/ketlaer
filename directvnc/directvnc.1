.SH NAME
directvnc - a vnc client for the linux framebuffer device
.SH SYNOPSIS
directvnc server:display [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B DirectVNC 
is a client implementing the remote framebuffer protocol (rfb) which is
used by VNC servers. If a VNC server is running on a machine you can connect
to it using this client and have the contents of its display shown on your
screen. Keyboard and mouse events are sent to the server, so you can basically
control a VNC server remotely. There are servers (and other clients) freely
available for all operating systems.

What makes DirectVNC different from other unix vnc clients is that it uses the
linux framebuffer device through the DirectFB library which enables it to run
on anything that has a framebuffer without the need for a running X server.
This includes embedded devices.  DirectFB even uses acceleration features of
certain graphics cards. Thus a lot of configuration can be done by creating the
library specific configuration file /etc/directfbrc or the program-specific
configuration file /etc/directfbrc.directvnc. See directfbrc(5) or find out all
about DirectFB here:

    www.directfb.org

DirectVNC basically provides a very thin VNC client for unix framebuffer systems.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -h, --help
display help output and exit
.TP 5
.B -v, --version
output version information and exit
.TP 5
.B -p, --password
password string to be passed to the server for authentication. Use this with
care!
.TP 5
.B -b, --bpp
the bits per pixel to be used by the client. Currently only 16 and 24 bpp
are available.
.TP 5
.B -e --encodings
DirectVNC supports several different compression methods to encode
screen updates; this option specifies a set of them to use in order of
preference. Encodings are specified separated with spaces, and must
thus be enclosed in quotes if more than one is specified. Available
encodings, in default order for a remote connection, are "copyrect
tight hextile zlib corre rre raw". For a local connection (to the same
machine), the default order to try is "raw copyrect tight hextile zlib
corre rre". Raw encoding is always assumed as a last option if no
other encoding can be used for some reason. 
.TP 5
.B -f --pollfrequency
time in ms to wait between polls for screen updates when no events are to be
processed. This reduces cpu and network load. Default is 50 ms.
.TP 5
.B -s, --shared (default)
Don't disconnect already connected clients.
.TP 5
.B -n, --noshared
Disconnect already connected clients.
.TP 5
.B -n, --nolocalcursor
Disable local cursor tracking By default, and if the server is capable of the
SoftCursor encoding, mouse movements do not generate framebuffer updates and
the cursor state is kept locally. This removes mouse pointer lag and lets the
connection appear faster.

.TP 5
.B -c --compresslevel level
Use specified compression level (0..9) for "tight" and "zlib"
encodings (only usable with servers capable of those encodings).  Level 1
uses minimum of CPU time and achieves weak compression ratios, while level 9
offers best compression but is slow in terms of CPU time consumption on the
server side. Use high levels with very slow network connections, and low
levels when working over high\-speed LANs. It's not recommended to use
compression level 0, reasonable choices start from the level 1.

.TP 5
.B -q --quality level
Use the specified image quality level (0..9) for "tight"
encoding (only usable with servers capable of those encodings). 
Specifying this option allows "tight" encoder to use lossy JPEG compression.
Quality level 0 denotes bad image quality but very impressive compression
ratios, while level 9 offers very good image quality at lower compression
ratios. Note that "tight" encoder uses JPEG to encode only those screen areas
that look suitable for lossy compression, so quality level 0 does not always
mean unacceptable image quality.

.TP 5
.B -m --modmap PATH
Path to the modmap (subset of X-style) file to load. With this option, it is
possible to set an alternative keyboard layout, with ability to support non-latin
characters such as Cyrillic. A plain text file, containing a subset of xmodmap(1)
syntax (only keycode expressions are recognized with up to four KEYSYMNAMEs) can
be converted into the format that directvnc understands, and can be loaded upon
directvnc startup with this option.

.SH LIMITATIONS
At the moment, it is still necessary to use the -bpp command line option to set color
depth. When negotiating with the remote VNC server side, color depth supplied by the
server will be used. It is therefore necessary to make sure (at least in the present)
that screen color depth (default, or set in the DirectFB configuration file), color
depth supplied at the command line, and remote VNC server color depth all match.
