DirectVNC README
------------

   DirectVNC is a client implementing the remote framebuffer protocol (rfb)
   which is used by VNC servers. If a VNC server is running on a machine you
   can connect to it using this client and have the contents of its display
   shown on your screen. Keyboard and mouse events are sent to the server, so
   you can basically control a VNC server remotely. There are servers (and
   other clients) freely available for all operating systems.

   What makes DirectVNC different from other unix vnc clients is that it uses
   the linux framebuffer device through the DirectFB library which enables it
   to run on anything that has a framebuffer without the need for a running X
   server. This includes embedded devices. DirectFB even uses acceleration
   features of certain graphics cards. Find out all about DirectFB here:

   DirectVNC basically provides a very thin VNC client for unix framebuffer
   systems.
