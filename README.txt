Build environment:
==================

Use the toolchain named toolchain_mipsel-6.03-6.i586.rpm from 
the asus download (http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?product=19&model=O!Play%20HDP-R1&SLanguage=en-en&os=5).

Extract the toolchain fix (utility/toolchain) in the toolchain lib directory.

Set the environment KETLAER to /usr/local/etc/ketlaer.
Set the environment KETLAER_DIR to the absolute path 
of your ketlaer source dir.
Extend PATH to point to /usr/local/bin.

Ketlaer is intended to be build to /usr/local/etc/ketlaer. 
It is not recommended to change this at the moment.

Building:
=========

Most directories provide a ketlaer-build build script.

Build order:

utility/config
utility/libm2
libketlaer

(Now you can build TESTClient, if you are in a hurry)

Download qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.6.2 sources.
Unpack them in the utility directory. 
Overlay them with the ketlaer files.

utility/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.6.2
utility/Python-2.6.5
utility/sip-4.10.2
utility/pyqt-4.7.3

IMPORTANT:

After that copy all *.so* from the toolchain lib directory
to $KETLAER/lib with cp -d !!

Runtime enviroment (on realtek):
================================

Make a symbolic link /usr/local/etc/ketlaer to point to a r/w mounted usb-drive 
with the ketlaer build or a samba mount of the builded /usr/local/etc/ketlaer.  

Set the following environment:

export KETLAER=/usr/local/etc/ketlaer

export PATH=$KETLAER/bin:$KETLAER/python/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KETLAER/lib

export QWS_MOUSE_PROTO="usb"
export QWS_KEYBOARD="usb"

Starting a Qt program:
======================

Run stopall.

Choose one from the examples or demos directory.
Run it with ./program -qws -display DISPLAY, where DISPLAY 
is one of the following:

vnc	  (for vnc output)
rtd	  (for tv/hdmi output)
vnc:rtd	  (for both. colors will be wrong on vnc.)

Starting a PyQt4 program:
=========================

Run stopall.

Run it with python program.py -qws -display DISPLAY. See above
for the possible values of DISPLAY.

WebKit:
=======

Run examples/webkit/fancybrowser.


BUGS:
=====

- Qt will crash on shutdown of program. Seems to be related to toolchain.
- Lots of others still to discover :-)
